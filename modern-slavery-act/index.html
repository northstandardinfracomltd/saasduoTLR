        Modern Slavery Statement Letter<br /><br />
        — Introduction
        <br /><br />
        This is the Modern Slavery Act Statement of North Standard Infracom
        (SaaSduo) ("the Company"). This statement is made pursuant to Section 54
        of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and sets out the steps taken by the
        Company to prevent and combat modern slavery and human trafficking in
        its operations and supply chains.
        <br /><br />
        — Our Commitment
        <br /><br />
        The Company is committed to upholding the highest standards of ethical
        conduct and ensuring that slavery and human trafficking have no place in
        its business activities. We recognize our responsibility to take
        effective measures to prevent and eradicate such practices within our
        sphere of influence.
        <br /><br />
        — Our Business
        <br /><br />
        SaaSduo is engaged in video and doc productions. We operate in
        accordance with the laws and regulations of the United Kingdom and
        adhere to international human rights principles.
        <br /><br />
        — Supply Chains
        <br /><br />
        The Company acknowledges that modern slavery can exist within complex
        global supply chains. To address this, we take the following steps:
        <br /><br />
        1) Risk Assessment: We regularly assess the risks of modern slavery
        within our supply chains, considering geographical locations, types of
        suppliers, and the nature of the products or services procured.<br />
        2) Supplier Due Diligence: We conduct due diligence on our suppliers to
        ensure they comply with the Modern Slavery Act and applicable
        international standards. This includes evaluating their policies,
        practices, and transparency regarding their workforce.<br />
        3) Contractual Obligations: We include clauses in our supplier contracts
        that require compliance with the Modern Slavery Act and the principles
        outlined in this statement.<br />
        4) Training: We provide training to our employees and suppliers on
        recognizing and reporting signs of modern slavery, both internally and
        within the supply chain.<br />
        5) Whistleblowing: We maintain a confidential whistleblowing mechanism
        for employees and suppliers to report any concerns related to modern
        slavery, ensuring that their identities are protected.
        <br /><br />
        — Actions Taken
        <br /><br />
        The Company is committed to taking appropriate actions in response to
        any identified instances of modern slavery or human trafficking, which
        may include:
        <br /><br />
        1) Terminating relationships with non-compliant suppliers.<br />
        2) Reporting any criminal activities to the relevant authorities.<br />
        3) Providing support to affected individuals, where applicable.
        <br /><br />
        — Performance Indicators and Targets
        <br /><br />
        The Company will continually assess its efforts to combat modern slavery
        by measuring and monitoring relevant key performance indicators. We will
        set specific targets and objectives to improve our anti-slavery efforts
        and regularly review our progress.
        <br /><br />
        — Conclusion
        <br /><br />
        This Modern Slavery Act Statement reflects the commitment of SaaSduo to
        addressing modern slavery and human trafficking within its operations
        and supply chains. We will continually strive to ensure that our
        business activities uphold the principles of fairness, transparency, and
        respect for human rights.
